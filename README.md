 Student Course Management System

A mini relational database project designed to manage students, courses, and their enrollments.  
This project demonstrates **SQL schema design, constraints, sample data insertion, and query writing** for common use cases in a course management system.

---

## Database Schema
The system uses **three core tables**:

- **student** → stores student details (ID, name, contact, email, city, DOB)
- **course** → stores course details (ID, name, fees)
- **enrollments** → maps students to courses with enrollment dates

---

## Tasks Covered
1. Create tables with constraints  
2. Insert sample records (3–5 per table)  
3. SQL queries for:
   - Displaying student details
   - Filtering by city
   - Courses with fees > 5000
   - Students with their enrolled courses (joins)
   - Counting enrollments per course
   - Grouping enrollments by city
   - Courses with more than 1 student (HAVING)
   - Students with total enrolled courses (GROUP BY + ORDER BY)
   - Students with course names ordered by enrollment date
   - City with highest number of enrolled students
